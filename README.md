## Exercise 1

Open the program called *string_utils.py*

* For each function, remove the line containing the pass statement and implement the functionality described in the docstrings.
* Run the unit tests to validate that the implementation passes unit tests. 

```
python3 -m unittest test_string_utils.py 
```

## Exercise 2

A [palindrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome) word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward.

Open the program called *palindrome.py*

* For each function, remove the line containing the pass statement and implement the functionality described in the docstrings.
* Run the unit tests to validate that the implementation passes unit tests. 

```
python3 -m unittest test_palindrome.py 
```

## Exercise 3 

An [anagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram) is a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another.  

Open the program called *anagram.py*

* Remove the line containing the pass statement and implement the functionality described in the docstring.
* Run the unit tests to validate that the implementation passes unit tests. 

```
python3 -m unittest test_anagram.py 
```

## Exercise 4

Open the program called *list_utils.py*

* For each function, remove the line containing the pass statement and implement the functionality described in the docstrings.
* Run the unit tests to validate that the implementation passes unit tests. 

```
python3 -m unittest test_list_utils.py 
```
